PostProcessingNCSM
========

v0.1 released 23-02-12

PostProcessingNCSM is a tool to post process data generated from calculations
at the department of Subatomic Physics, Chalmers. It is based on an existing
framework made by various employees at Subatomic Physics. The ab initio
no-core shell model (NCSM) is a many-body framework for calculating properties
of light nuclei using realistic nuclear Hamiltonians. It is a
configuration-interaction method meaning that the energy eigenvalues and
eigenstates are obtained in an exact-diagonalization scheme with truncated
many-body basis spaces. A specific aim of the NCSM campaign is to use the region
of light nuclei as a benchmark for testing modern low-energy nuclear
interactions.
